Hello! I am currently a 4th-year PhD student in Computer Science at Arizona State University (ASU), advised by [Prof. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). I completed both my B.S. and M.S. degrees through the Accelerated 4+1 program at ASU. Additionally, I have had my research internship at the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI), supervised by [Prof. Kristina Lerman](https://www.isi.edu/people-lerman/).


Research Interests
======
* **Social Media Mining:** Employ advanced analytics to extract patterns and trends in user interactions, aiming to understand how individuals and communities engage with content on various platforms.  
* **Computational Social Science:** Connect diverse online and offline data to analyze complex social phenomena; Apply machine learning techniques to detect mis-/disinforamtion.
* **Natural Language Processing:** Focus on deploying large language models to solve real-world challenges.
