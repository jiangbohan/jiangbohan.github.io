Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Arizona State University (ASU), advised by [Prof. Huan Liu](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/huanliu/). My research lies at the intersection of social media mining, computational social science, and natural language processing. I am particularly interested in understanding and mitigating online harms such as disinformation, echo chambers, and conspiracies, and in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for social good.

Research Interests
======
* **Social Media Mining:** Developing advanced algorithms to collect, model, and analyze large-scale social media data, aiming to provide actionable insights for real-world applications and decision making.
* **Computational Social Science:** Leveraging computational methods and AI tools to interpret social phenomena and address pressing social problems, including mis-/disinformation and polarization.
* **Natural Language Processing & LLMs:** Employing large language models to solve real-world problems, with a focus on LLMs for social science, LLM-as-a-Judge/Evaluator, and human–AI interaction.
